Title: File Line Sampler
Version: 0.3-0
Description: A simple package for reading subsamples of flat text files
    by line in a reasonably efficient manner.  We do so by sampling 
    as the input file is scanned and randomly choosing whether or not to
    dump the current line to an external temporary file.  This 
    temporary file is then read back into R.  For (aggressive) 
    downsampling, this is a very effective strategy; for resampling,
    you are much better off reading the full dataset into memory.
